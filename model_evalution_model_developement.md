**PART 2 — MODEL EVALUATION (Detailed)**
Model evaluation tells you how good your model is.
Different metrics for:
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Deep learning

1. Classification Evaluation Metrics
(For spam/ham, fraud detection, cancer prediction)

Confusion Matrix
TP | FP
FN | TN

Accuracy
(TP + TN) / Total

Precision
How many predicted positives are correct?
TP / (TP + FP)

Recall (Sensitivity)
How many actual positives were detected?
TP / (TP + FN)

F1-score
Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

AUC-ROC
Measures model separation capability.

When to use what?
Situation                Best metric
Balanced data           Accuracy
Imbalanced data         F1-score / AUC
When FP is costly       Precision
When FN is costly       Recall

2. Regression Evaluation Metrics
(For price prediction, demand forecasting)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
Average absolute error: |y - ŷ|

MSE (Mean Square Error)
Squared error — punishes large errors.

RMSE
Square root of MSE.

R² Score
How well the model explains variance: 1 – (SSR / SST)

3. Clustering Evaluation Metrics

Silhouette Score
Measures separation between clusters (0–1).

Dunn Index
Cluster compactness.

Davies–Bouldin Index
Lower is better.

Elbow Method
Choosing number of clusters.

4. Deep Learning Evaluation

Training loss
Validation loss
Validation accuracy
Overfitting detection
Confusion matrix

5. Cross-Validation

Evaluates model stability.

Types:
- k-fold CV
- Stratified k-fold
- Leave-one-out

Example:
cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

6. Model Monitoring (MLOps)

After deployment:
- Drift detection
- Performance decay
- Logging
- Retraining triggers

Metrics monitored:
- Prediction latency
- Throughput
- Error rate
- Real-world accuracy

**FINAL SUMMARY (Interview Ready)**
