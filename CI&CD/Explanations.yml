CICD - GitHub Actions
YAML(Yet Another Markup Language )   It is a human-readable data format used to store or transfer data — just like JSON or XML, but simpler and easier to read. 

GitHub uses YAML for workflows

Features                        Description
Lists                           Start with a -
Key-Value                       Key: value
Objects                         Objects: Properties of Objects

YAML is used to write data in a structured way — especially in:
Configuration files (settings)
Data exchange between applications
Cloud setups (like Docker, Kubernetes)
AI/ML model configs (like PyTorch, Hugging Face)

Indentention is must

Example:
student:
  name: Ramesh Kumar
  age: 21
  course: B.Tech
  skills:
    - Python
    - Machine Learning
    - Data Science
  address:
    city: Chennai
    pincode: 600042
  is_graduated: false

Same in JSON Format
{
  "student": {
    "name": "Ramesh Kumar",
    "age": 21,
    "course": "B.Tech",
    "skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Data Science"],
    "address": {
      "city": "Chennai",
      "pincode": 600042
    },
    "is_graduated": false
  }
}

Docker Compose → docker-compose.yml
Kubernetes → deployment.yaml
GitHub Actions → .github/workflows/main.yml
Machine Learning → model configuration files

What is CI/CD ?
Build ->Unit Tests ->Deploy to stage ->Acceptance tests                                //Continuous Integration 
Build ->Unit Tests ->Deploy to stage ->Acceptance Tests ->Deploy to Production         //Continuous Deployment

Actions Overview 
Live in .GitHub/workflows folder
workflows for derived in YAML, Event oriented

Workflows:
Events trigger workflows
workflows contain jobs
jobs contain jobs
jobs conatin steps
steps are commands or actions
Runners Can an Virtual Machines

Jobs:
Workflows can conatin multiple jobs
jobs run in parallel by default
Each job runs on a Runner
Steps and Shell Commands run in sequence

Working:
The main branch, has one feature A, feature A branch of replica of main branch develop feature A , with testcase, build, test and merge with main branch, similar feature b, continuous integration.

Across Multiple team , Dev team, QA team, UAt team, Production House.

Key Steps

Dev team
Coding
Version Control
Code Review

QA team
Unit Testing
Integration testing
End 2 End testing

Continuous Integration -> Building, testing, notification, Fixing , RE build
Continous Deployment -> Deploy Different Server (like dev server, QA server, production server)
